# ---> End of Note <<---

This is my first project after learning react other than the common "To-Do List". I apologise for anything wrong or less optimised in this project as I am a beginner in React and still learning . It will have the sound effects much similar to the real keyboards and also the controls will be very easy.

# ps : Please feel free to report any issues with this project and contribute to it

# Key Features :
1) Has play-with-hover option
2) You can record what you play : This is achieved by JavaScript WebAudio API
3) Rest features will be updated as I go forward with this project
